HelloWorldContract is developed with Remix IDE and is presented as #Blockgames Task 2 which determines students progression through the competition stages.
It contains 3 directories:

1. 'HelloWorld': Holds the Hello World contract written in Solidity - An object-oriented high level programming language, denoted with .sol suffix in file name.
2. 'scripts': Holds two scripts to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'artifacts': Contains two files for the 'HelloWorld' contract's Bytecode otherwise known as BIN and its Application Binary Interface (ABI).

SCRIPTS

The 'scripts' folder contains example async/await scripts for deploying the 'Storage' contract.
For the deployment of any other contract, 'contractName' and 'constructorArgs' should be updated (along with other code if required). 
Scripts have full access to the web3.js and ethers.js libraries.

To run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.

Output from script will appear in remix terminal.
